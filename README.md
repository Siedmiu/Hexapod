We are a group of students from Gda≈Ñsk University of Technology. Our goal is to create a 6 legged spider robot or a "Hexapod" in short.
Our current goals include the ability to traverse difficult terrain, remote control via an android app. Multiple walking algorithms are going to be implemented and tested.
Hexapod capabilities planned for the future include autonomous walking with the ability to follow objects and people using neural networks and computer vision algorithms.
